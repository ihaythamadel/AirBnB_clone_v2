# A fabric script to send an archive file to a remote server and decompress it
```
archive_name = os.path.basename(archive_path)
archive_name_no_ext = os.path.splitext(archive_name)[0]
```

It performs two operations on a file path string referred to as archive_path:

```os.path.basename(archive_path)```
- returns the last component of the path, which in this case is the filename of the archive. 
- The returned value is then assigned to the variable archive_name.

```os.path.splitext(archive_name)[0]```
- splits the archive_name string into a tuple of the filename and extension and returns the filename (without the extension).
- The [0] index is used to access the first element of the tuple, which is the filename without the extension.
- The returned value is assigned to the variable archive_name_no_ext.

# os.path.basename(archive_path)
- ```os.path.basename(archive_path)``` is a function call to the ```basename()``` method of the ```os.path``` module in Python.
- This function is used to extract the base filename from a given path string ```archive_path```.

- The ```archive_path``` argument is a string that represents the path of the file, and can be either an absolute or relative path.
- The ```basename()``` function extracts the last component of the path, which is the filename of the file or directory, and returns it as a string.

For example, if ```archive_path``` is set to ```/home/user/Documents/archive.zip```, the ```basename()``` function will return the string ```archive.zip```, which is the name of the file in the specified path.

If the ```archive_path``` argument is not a valid path, or if it contains special characters or invalid characters that are not supported by the file system, then an exception will be raised.

Overall, ```os.path.basename(archive_path)``` is a convenient function for extracting the filename from a path string, and is commonly used in Python programs for file manipulation and management.
